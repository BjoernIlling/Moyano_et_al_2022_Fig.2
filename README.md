This repository contains all information required for reproducing Fig. 2 in Moyano et al's manuscript "Caught in the middle: Bottom-up and top-down processes impacting recruitment in a small pelagic fish", 
submitted for publication in Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries [(doi: tba)](link).

Fisheries data on Western Baltic Spring Spawning (WBSS) herring (_Clupea harengus_) were sourced from [ICES](https://standardgraphs.ices.dk/ViewCharts.aspx?key=13313). Additional data on larval and juvenile WBSS herring were sourced from the 
N20 and GERAS indices, respectively. The N20 was created based on the number of larvae reaching 20 mm by the end of the spawning season (i.e. June) in Greifswald Bay, a major spawning area for WBSS herring. 
The GERAS (German Autumn Acoustic Survey) recruitment index is estimated based on the number of 1-year-old juveniles, as defined by the first winter ring (1-wr) microscopically detected in the otolith. 

Please be referred to the [ICES website](https://standardgraphs.ices.dk/ViewCharts.aspx?key=13313) and the [original manuscript](link) for further details on the abbreviations used in each data column.
